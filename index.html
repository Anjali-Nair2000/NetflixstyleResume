        <h2>Global Process Owner • Demand Planner • Replenishment Lead</h2>

        <p>
            Across my career, I’ve led key functions in supply chain, demand planning, and replenishment—managing forecasting, inventory, and end-to-end planning operations for global and North American markets. I’ve served as a Replenishment Lead overseeing an 18-member team with 98%+ on-shelf availability, a Demand Planning Lead working across BY and LDE, and a Supply Chain Analyst managing seasonal categories. As a Global Process Owner, I’ve driven standardization, governance, and large-scale process improvements across regions. My experience also spans safety stock optimization, lead time reduction, planogram revamps, and building dashboards for visibility. Throughout these roles, I’ve consistently combined analytical thinking, cross-functional collaboration, and operational execution to deliver measurable, scalable results.
